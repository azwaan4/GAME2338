### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 5 stars and I give this game a 2.5 star rating.

## Summary
This game is about 4 astronauts on a 10 week space flight to Mars. The goal of the game is to survive until you get to Mars, and you do that with dice rolls. Upon starting the game, each of the 4 astronauts is given a completely random amount of health and dice rolls.

You get points from rolling dice, and can spend those points on different things, such as reparing the ship and character upgrades. However, the nature of the game is very frusturating. It almost seems as if the game wants you to fail. No matter how succesful you've been on your last several rolls, you'll almost always end with something bad happening, thus resetting/erasing some of your progress.

The story, while good and somewhat intriguing at first, quickly gets boring because of the brutal gameplay. It loses its suspense. Although it originally is the main focus, eventually, continously rolling horrible numbers makes you frusturated, which takes you out of the story.

## Final Thoughts
It's a good and fun idea for a game, but unfortunately, the difficult gameplay puts the enjoyment to a halt. I can definitely see what the developers were going for, but in my opinion, it shouldn't be nearly as challenging as it is, since it's a game based on chance. And when you're not doing good, it's not the players fault, it's the games fault, which just makes the experience as a whole worse.
