My games are Modern Warfare 2, Assassins Creed 3, and Grand Theft Auto 5.

Modern Warfare 2
I believe this game is quality because the reliability and usability is great. The gameplay is fast and rewarding, and it constantly provides that experience time and time again.

Assassins Creed 3
This game is good because of its correctness. Its core gameplay is still relatively the same, but it improves from the previous titles in the series, while at the same time being able to differentiate itself.

Grand Theft Auto 5
GTA 5 is quality because of its usability and maintainability. It's extremely easy to just pick up and play, it's fun, and it doesn't have any major noticeable bugs or glitches.
