I rate games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 10 star rating.

## Summary
This game is about you, the player, crash landing in the ocean, where the player finds a lighthouse that leads to an abandoned underwater city called Rapture. You have to help find and save the family of a man named Atlas. Your other main goal is to figure out what exactly Rapture is, and why and how you're here. Most importantly, how to get out.

The story of Bioshock is one of the best I've ever experienced, regardless of medium. The characters are all lifelike and the environment of Rapture is truly one of a kind. The two blend together flawlessly, creating a living world that hooks you and never lets go. The sound effects, such as the echoes of the whales around you, truly make you feel like you're there.

The gameplay helps push the narrative along, while also being very enjoyable. It makes you feel vunerable; it seems as if you're always about to run out of EVE hypo's and ammo. Which is a good thing, because in a broken and run down atmosphere, that's exactly how the player should feel.

## Final Thoughts
I basically enjoy everything about the first Bioshock. The story, the world, the sound effects, the characters, and gameplay, are all phenomenal, in my opinion. They all benefit from each other, which in turn, elevates the game experience as a whole. It's without a doubt, one of the smartest and well crafted games I've ever (and probably will ever) play.
