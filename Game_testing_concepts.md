Outline:

Make sure online doesn't somehow interfere with the campaign
Get everything as stable as possible
Don't let "out of the world" type glitches occur
See if player spawns into level and everything loads correctly
Have usability testing because players think differently than the programmers
Usability testing lets the developers know what mechanics do and don't work

Review:
The Bungie game testers have smart techniques that get good results. I think that their approach to usability testing is especially clever for a few reasons. It allows for the level design to be critiqued, so that if a player doesn't know where he is supposed to go, they know that they need to work on it. The same can be said for gameplay mechanics, because if most of the testers don't find the game to be enjoyable, then that's an important aspect to fix.
