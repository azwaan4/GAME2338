**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Yes, the controls were easy to understand and the gameplay loop was consistent.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ No.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The balance could be a lot better. The difficulty was really easy, even on hard mode. That's the problem with the target audience, because my age group is the general age group. It's simply a negative of the gameplay.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, there hasn't been a good first person RPG in quite some time, so this is great timing.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ For the most part. There were a few occasions where it didn't exactly match up. For example, my companion is suppoed to be really kind hearted, except she was totally fine with me killing an entire town. She even helped me do it. Small things like that took me out of the immersion.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ At first, I had a lot of fun. But after the first hour or so, I realized that the exploration and combat were slightly above average at the very best.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I only ran into one glitch, where all the audio just stopped for about 5-10 seconds, and then continued. It stopped once I got out of that specific area.
