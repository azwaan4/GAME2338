### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 8.5 star rating.

## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.
This game is about the player character's journey to defeat Alduin, a dragon who has the power to destroy the world. You play as the first Dragonborn in hundreds of years, which is someone who has the ability to harness the power of a dragon and use "shouts", which are unique powers. It is open world and takes place in a medieval setting.

The RPG aspects of the game are solid, but not great. Most main quests usually end with you being the good guy. It's kind of difficult to play as an evil character, and in my opinion, that's a bad thing for an RPG game. The combat is average at best. The melee combat gameplay is essenntially swinging your sword until the enemy dies, there's nothing about the combat that differentiates itself from other games. It lacks rhythm.

With that being said, it's still a really good game. The open world is absolutely beautiful, and features different weather types depending on where you go. It has a phenomenal soundtrack, which fits the tone and world perfectly. The game is incredibly immersive, and fighting your way through dungeons and being rewarded at the end is always fun. Skyrim is excellent at letting you play how you want to, combat wise. You can be a mage, an archer, a sword and shield character, or a mix of all three. The possibilities are endless.


## Final Thoughts
My favorite part of Skyrim is simply what happens on your way to the quest location. It's not about the destination, but the journey. The world is very detailed and I love being immersed in it. However, the gameplay and RPG aspects could definitely be improved. The combat lacks quality and the RPG elements aren't as fleshed out as they arguably should be. But, the open world and story make up for it, which is why it's such a memorable experience.
