### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 8 star rating.

## Summary
This game is about competing in rallies. There are timed events that the player can compete in, as well as a track creator. Dirt 4 focuses on off-road racing and has several different weather conditions for the player to race in, which makes the gameplay more interesting and brings a challenge to every race.

The track creator is a lot of fun to use. It has a ton of variety and the UI is very simple, which makes it really easy to make tracks. In addition to the track itself, the player is also able to change the time of day and weather.

The controls are really smooth and feel very realistic. The cars are easy to handle and fun to drive, and the particle systems, such as the mud kicking out from underneath your tires, make it incredibly immersive. The steering isn't too easy or too hard to get the hang of, so it's perfect for a person like me, who never plays racing games.

## Final Thoughts
I really liked the feel of the steering and the environment details in Dirt 4. However, the career mode could have been a tiny bit more fleshed out, in my opinion. Even then, the game still provides a great driving experience that is both rewarding and fun.
