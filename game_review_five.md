### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 8 star rating.

## Summary
This game is a deck builder and dungeon crawler that takes place in a fantasy world. The game works by doing a quest for every card you draw. In total, there are 22 missions. As you play through the game, it gives you different challenges, but they don't always help you with your direct missionn objective. You can beat these challenges in several different ways, such as rolling dice or spinning a wheel, then stopping it, so it lands on the correct spot.

The game has several stats the player needs to keep track of, such as their amount of money and how much they're eating, because it's possible to die from starvation. In addition, there are different kinds of cards that make the player fight against several enemies, where the camera becomes third person. If the player dies in combat, they have to restart that mission. This admittedly can be frusturating if you die several times in a row.

The combat can be fun and challenging, as you can equip different weapons for each battle. The weapons are dependant on their classes, which are one-handed, two-handed, and heavy. The gameplay can be interesting because you have to strategize what weapon is best depending on the enemy. You can have one out of four companions join you in the majority of the missions, which can provide some more fun in combat.


## Final Thoughts
Having to rely on pure luck when drawing cards can definitely get frusturating. If you get dealt a bad hand, then the gameplay is less enjoyable. However, getting accustomed to the different weapon and class builds makes for a rewardinngn experience. In addition, once you get the hang of the gameplay, it gets pretty immersive and exciting. The combat is fun and having to focus on the strengths of the enemies makes it challenging.
