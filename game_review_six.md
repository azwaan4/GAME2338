### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 6 star rating.

## Summary
This is a multiplayer game where there are 6 total players. Two of them are sharks, and the other four are scuba divers hunting for treasure. It reminds me a lot of Left 4 Dead's multiplayer, which puts human survivors against different kinds of zombies. Unfortunately, it's not quite as good.

Playing as a shark can definitely provide a decent, but not great experience. The controls take a bit to get used to and feel stiff, which can be frusturating sometimes. The divers have a drone that they follow that takes them to treasure (loot) and weapons. There are 5 maps, each having different environments, such as a sunken ship and a dark cavern. However, the maps are too dark. There were times when I had difficulty seeing in front of me, which led to me getting killed.

On top of that, the graphics are bad, especially for the year it came out, 2014. A good amount of the textures are pretty low resolution, and the models seem to have a small polygon amount. The level design, while it initally seems interesting, quickly gets boring and repetetive, just like the gameplay. Too many glitches hinder the experience even more. There were several occasions I had playing as a diver, where I'd get stuck on some corner.

# Final Thoughts
The game is fun at first, but it quickly gets frusturating and repetitive. Any sense of immersion can be ruined by the large amount of glitches, which unfortunately seem to happen quite frequently. However, the atmosphere is really great. The sound design and feeling of vast openness provides a good sense of tension and suspense. Overall, it has some fun aspects, but the glitches and repetitiveness drag the game down.
