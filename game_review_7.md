### Rating
I rate games from 1 to 10 stars and I give this game a 8 star rating.

## Summary
Super Mario Maker 2 has several different modes: the main game, multiplayer, and a level editor, the latter of which is the best part about the game. There are many kinds of environments for the level editor/creator. Some of them include a jungle, a snowy mountain, and in air or underground. Players can share their level creations with thousands of other players, which is a really cool aspect of the game

The game offers different objectives that the player has to accomplish to beat the level. A few examples include a boss to defeat, a certain amount of coins to collect, and so forth. There's even objects such as rising acid/lava, so that the player will have to manange their time as well as precision.

The one problem I have with the game is it's way that it sorts the user created levels. Obviously, players title their levels and other players can rate them. However, some of the high rated levels are either too easy, too hard, or just not creative enough. This is because of player bias, and everyone has a different idea of what makes something good. Not only that, but a great level could possibly never be played by anyone, simply because the creator is bad at promoting it.



## Final Thoughts

The main story has more than enough content to justify a full $60 purchase. Throw in a pretty great level editor along with it, and the game is really fun. There are lots of different options and ways a player could take their level. Unfortunately, the bad online aspect hinders the experience of playing the best the game has to offer. This means that despite the large amount of tools at the player's disposal, it's hard to see it's full potential.
